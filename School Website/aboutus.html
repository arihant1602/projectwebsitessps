<p>Sai Public School imbibes its philosophy from the teachings of Shri Shirdi Sai Baba, that is ‘Shraddha’- meaning faith and ‘Saburi’- meaning patience. </p>

    <p>This educational venture is managed under the patronage of our Chairman – Revered Dr. C.B. Satpathy Ji, who was moved by the pain of a child while parting from his parents at the time of leaving for a Residential School.</p>

        <p>Shirdi Sai Public School is committed to ensuring that children assimilate the skills required to become competent individuals with academic excellence and also equip them with skills required to adapt to the requirements of the constantly changing world. Our school is Co – Educational and is located at Sai Nagar; Kanth Road, Moradabad.</p>

            <p>One of its kind, our school aims at providing a nurturing environment and groom our students to respect nature, be conscientious in using natural resources, develop a positive attitude towards life, sportsmanship and confidence. </p>
                <p>Our curriculum is based on the guidelines from Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). We also incorporate a spectrum of co-curricular and extra-curricular activities into the schedule so as to assist the development of your child.</p>

                    <p>For pre-schoolers, these activities include fine motor and gross motor activities. For older children, activities include Performing Arts, Fine Arts, Sports, Theatre, Story Telling, Project Based Learning, Sewa projects, IT based projects & programs, Beyond Classroom initiatives etc. The student-teacher ratio is low to enable individual care & attention for your child. We provide a ‘Uniform system of assessment, examination and report card’ which is aimed at standardizing teaching and evaluation across the entire school, as per the directives/ guidelines of the CBSE.</p>
